## project overview
**the analysis focuses on understanding survival patterns based on passenger demographics,travel class, and family groups.All data cleaning analysis and visiualization were perform in Excel without external tools.**

## Data sources
Titanic dataset:the primary dataset used for this analysis "titanic dataset csv" file containing detailed information about those on board

### Tool
- Excel

### Data cleaning and preparations
In the initial preparation phase we performed the following task
1.	Data Cleaning (handling missing values, creating new columns)
2.	Exploratory Analysis (pivot tables and formulas)
3.	Visualization (pie, donut, bar, and column charts).
   
### Exploratory Data Analysis
EDA involved exploring the titanic dataset to answer key questions such as:
1.	How does passenger class affect survival rates?
2.	How does family size impact survival?
3.	Does port of embarkation affect survival?
4.	What is the relationship between age and survival?
5.	How does deck (cabin location) affect survival?

### Data Analysis 
- Handled missing age and embarkation values.
- Extracted passenger titles from names.
-	Created derived fields (Age group, Family group, deck)
-	Used pivot tables to summarize survival trends.
-	Compared class, gender, and family group survival.
-	Analyzed average fare across different groups.
  
  ### Insights & Key Findings.
1. First-class passengers had the highest survival rates.
2. Small family groups had better survival chances than large families
3. Embarkation indirectly influenced survival due to class distribution
4.	Survival rates were higher for children and younger adults compared to the elderly.
5.	Cabin location mattered - passengers on upper decks had higher survival chances
   
  ### Recommendations
1. Enhance dashboards – Add slicers, filters, and interactivity in Excel to allow deeper insights (e.g., survival by multiple conditions like gender + class).
2. Compare with modern datasets – Use the skills gained to analyze real-world datasets (sales, healthcare, finance) and build domain-specific dashboards.
3. Storytelling focus – Present findings not just with numbers, but as insights about social class, gender roles, and human behavior during the tragedy.
   
###  Limitations
1.	Many records have missing values which reduces accuracy.
2.	Grouping variables like “Age group” or “Family group” introduces assumptions that may not fully capture survival behavior.
